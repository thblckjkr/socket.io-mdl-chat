# [mdl-socket-chat](http://mdl-socket-chat.herokuapp.com/)
Chat application with multiple rooms and custom usernames, made with [Socket.io](http://socket.io/) and [Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io/)

> This project it's a mix of a previous project that i made for a intranet chat AND a mix with some of the design and functionality of [another project](https://github.com/leevilehtonen/mdl-socket-chat). Yo can see the original project on the first commit.
